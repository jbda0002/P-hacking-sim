In the paper "Preregistration is important, but not enough" we examine the consequences of two different cases of the data structure; where both the variable of interest $x$ and the covariates $z$ have the same distribution i.e. both binary or both normally distributed. However, there are also the cases where one is binary and the other is normally distributed. The result for these cases can be found in this \textit{Supplementary Information} in the section "\nameref{result}". The first figure, \ref{fig:appfigure1}, contains the baseline model. This is the figure that all the other figures are compared to to see the increase of the false-positive probability (FPP) or false-positive ratio (FPR) for any of the flexibilities investigated. For this figure the sample size is set to 200, the correlation between the dependent variable and the covariates is $\textit{r}=0.2$, two covariates are used and no outlier criteria are used. For each of the figures in this section one of these flexibilities are changed. Figure \ref{fig:appfigure2} illustrates the consequences of a increase in the correlation between the dependent variable and the covariates, Figure \ref{fig:appfigure3} illustrates what happens when using one more dependent variable and the average between these two, Figure \ref{fig:appfigure4} illustrates the consequences of using several outlier criteria, Figure \ref{fig:appfigure5} illustrates the increase in FPP and FPR when using three instead of two covariates and finally in Figure \ref{fig:appfigure6} shows what happens to the FPP and FPR when increasing the sample size.  \\

In the second part of this \textit{Supplementary Information}, in the section "\nameref{resultBC}", is the same set of figures, but in this case the critical value has been corrected using Bonferroni correction. The figures follow the same order as the first section, first a baseline model with Bonferroni correction in Figure \ref{fig:appfigure7} and afterwards the effect of changing one of the flexibilities in Figure \ref{fig:appfigure8} to Figure \ref{fig:appfigure12}. \\
In the final part of the \textit{Supplementary Information}, in the section "\nameref{overviewtable}", full tables of all the results from the simulation can be found. Here are  results both with and without Bonferroni correction.\\

\subsection{Results without correcting p-values}
The following supporting figures ($S1 - S6$) show additional conditions that influence the FPP and FPR when p-values are not corrected.

\subsection{Results when using Bonferroni correction of p-values}
\label{resultBC}

In this section, we present the same analyses, but with Bonferroni correction of p-values. This means that the critical value ($\alpha$) now has a correction such that $\alpha = 0.05 / #Number~of~test~in~each~model$. So the critical value will only be 0.05 in the case where there are no interactions between the variable of interest and the covariates. The critical value is corrected for each test such that it can differ within each model set depending on how many interactions there are per model. 

Table \ref{tab:resultFullBC} shows the FPP and FPR for the full model sets under different conditions with Bonferroni correction. Here there is no split between each model set. The correction lowers the FPR to the expected 5\%, but there is still an issue when not including main effects and having binomial variables.

\subsection{Overview tables}
\label{overviewtable}
Readers interested in examining specific results from the simulation can consult the following overview tables. Table \ref{tab:apptabFull} and Table \ref{tab:apptabFullBC} contain the results for the full simulation of the different sets. Table \ref{tab:apptabFull} contains all the results when there is no correction of the p-value and \ref{tab:apptabFullBC} contains the results when Bonferroni correction is used. For each set the result of the false-positive probability (FPP) and false-positive ratio (FPR) is shown with and without the restriction that main effects should always follow an interaction and for the different other flexibilities used in the paper i.e. increasing the number of covariates, increasing the number of dependent variables, using several outlier criteria. This is shown with different data structures for the variable of interest and covariates.
