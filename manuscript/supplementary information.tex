\subsection{Results when using Bonferroni correction}

In this section, we present the same analyses but with Bonferroni correction applied. This means that the critical value ($\alpha$) now has a correction such that $\alpha = 0.05 / #Number~of~test~in~each~set$. So the critical value will only be 0.05 in the case where there is no interactions between the variable of interest and the covariates. The critical value is corrected for each test such that it can differ within each model set depending on how many interactions there are per model. 

Table \ref{tab:resultFullBC} shows the FPP and FPR for the full model sets under different conditions when there is used Bonferroni correction. Here there is no split between each model set.This lowers the FPR to the expected 5\% but there is still an issue when not including main effects and having binomial variables.

\caption{The description of this figure is the same as for Figure \ref{fig:appfigure1} with the only difference being that we applied Bonferroni correction. This figure therefore shows the probability of the false positive probability and false positive ratio given different model sets, the presence of main effects when having interactions (i.e., With restrictions for interactions or No restrictions for interactions) and different distributions of the variable of interest and covariates. Sample size was set to 200, a correlation between the dependent variable and covariates was $\textit{r}=0.2$ and we used two covariates. The false positive probability is shown in black and the false positive ratio in red. Dashed blacked line indicates 0.05. }
