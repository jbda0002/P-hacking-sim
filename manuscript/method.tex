\section{Method}
Focusing on different flexibilities in data analysis, we investigated the false-positive probability (FPP) and false-positive ratio (FPR) for a key independent variable that was uncorrelated with any other variable using a simulation. We used the previously discussed flexibilities i.e., different model specifications, outlier deletion present or absent, several dependent variables, and different sample sizes. The effect of flexibilities were tested using different correlations between the dependent variable and the covariates, and different data structures. Even though in some simple cases it would be possible to calculate a closed-form solution for the FPP and FPR e.g., when looking at only one main effect, we used a simulation since it was not clear how the combination of different flexibilities used here would impact the FPP and FPR.\\

\subsection{Model Set}
When a researcher has to select which model(s) to use for testing a hypothesis, there are a lot of possibilities regarding what variables to collect and how they should enter the model. In a completely randomized experiment, it would only be necessary to focus on the key variable of interest, which we define as $x_1$, and the dependent variable, $y$ \citep{angrist2008mostly}. However, in many cases a researcher is either interested in how the variable of interest interacts with other variables or there is a need to control for other variables, which we call covariates and denote as $Z=(z_1,z_2,..,z_n)$. For instance, this could be the case in a quasi-experimental setting where no complete randomization could be obtained or for observational data where it is necessary to control for different variables to avoid bias \citep{angrist2008mostly}. \\ 
To better understand the construction of model sets, we divided the models into seven sets based on different interaction structures. The first three sets contained the key variable of interest and simple interactions, whereas the last four sets were the combinations of the first three sets. An example of the first three model sets is shown in Table \ref{modelsets1}. For clarity, the model equations exclude the constant and the coefficient in front of each variable. The first set only includes models of the main effects of the variable of interest and the covariates (ME). The second set includes models with a main effect of the variable of interest and interactions between the variable of interest and the covariates ($X \times Cov$). The third set includes models with a main effect of the variable of interest and covariate-covariate interactions ($Cov \times Cov$).
To obtain the last four model sets, we combined the first three model sets. There are two ways of combining the three first sets: a) restricting the combined sets so that the corresponding main effects have to be included when there is an interaction or b) allowing interaction effects without the corresponding main effect terms. In Table \ref{modelsets2}, we show the combination of all sets when the main effects are included provided there is an interaction term. The other case, where the main effects are not required to follow, can be seen in the Supplementary Material in Table S1. \\

Equation (1) shows how to calculate the total number of models given one key variable of interest and a given number of covariates under restriction a) that models with interaction terms must include the corresponding main effects. Each underlined section in Equation (1) can also be used to calculate the size of the specified model set. The derivation of this equation can be found in the Supplementary Material under Case 2. \\

\begin{equation} 
\begin{aligned}
\#models={} & \underbrace{\left(2^n\right)}_{ME}+\underbrace{\sum^n_{j=1}{\left(2^j-1\right)\binom{n}{j}}}_{ME + HCI} + \\ 
& \underbrace{\sum^n_{j=2}{\binom{n}{j}\left(2^{\frac{j\left(j-1\right)}{2}}-1\right)}}_{ME + CCI} + \\
& \underbrace{\sum^n_{j=2}{\binom{n}{j}\left(2^j-1\right)\left(2^{\frac{j\left(j-1\right)}{2}}-1\right)}}_{ME + HCI + CCI}\ \  
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 

where $n$ denotes the number of covariates collected and $\binom{n}{j}$ is a binomial coefficient, the calculation of which is explained in the Supplementary Material under the Formula for Set Size section.
Equation (1) does not include the HCI, CCI, and HCI + CCI sets as these include interaction terms without the corresponding main effect terms, and these are therefore empty sets. For the case with two covariates, the total number of models is calculated as follows

\begin{equation*}
\centering
\left(2^2\right)+
\sum^2_{j=1}{\left(2^j-1\right) \binom{2}{j}}+
\sum^2_{j=2}{\binom{2}{j}\left(2^{\frac{j\left(j-1\right)}{2}}-1\right)}+  
\sum^2_{j=2}{\binom{2}{j}\left(2^j-1\right)\left(2^{\frac{j\left(j-1\right)}{2}}-1\right)}
\end{equation*}

which is equal to $4+5+1+3*1=13$. The number of models in each model set for the different number of covariates given condition a) that main effects must always follow interaction effects can be seen in Table 3. The number of models in condition b) without the main effects restriction can be seen in Table S6 in the Supplementary Material. \\

In the simulation, we focused on two to four covariates as this was enough to give an idea of how the increase in the size of the model set affected the FPP and FPR. 

\subsection{Outlier Criteria}
Following the findings of \cite{Leyes2013}, we included four different outlier criteria. Three of the criteria were based on the standard deviation ($SD = 2$, $SD = 2.5$, and $SD = 3$), and the remaining criterion used the interquartile range \citep{Rousseeuw2011}. Outlier criteria were applied to all variables in a dataset by omitting all observations that exceeded the outlier criteria from the analysis.

\subsection{Collecting Multiple Dependent Variables}
As in \cite{Simmons2011}, we tested the effect of using more than one dependent variable on the FPP and FPR. We simulated data with two correlated dependent variables (\textit{r}=0.5) and computed the average of the two dependent variables to yield a third dependent variable. With these three dependent variables, the model set expanded three times compared to only one dependent variable. 

\subsection{Data Generating Process}
As the goal of the simulation was to understand false-positive effects, the variable of interest was simulated without any correlation with either the dependent variable or any of the covariates. The variable of interest could either have a normal distribution (continuous variable) or a binomial distribution (binary variable). The covariates were simulated using the same distribution so that all covariate distributions in a dataset were either normal or binomially distributed. As our target analysis was linear regression, the dependent variable was always simulated as a normal distribution. There were four different combinations of the variable of interest and covariate distributions: a continuous variable of interest and continuous covariates, a binary variable of interest and continuous covariates, a continuous variable of interest and binary covariates, and a binary variable of interest and binary covariates. The correlation between the dependent variable and covariates was simulated with three different levels (\textit{r} = 0.2, \textit{r} = 0.3, and \textit{r} = 0.4) corresponding to medium-strength correlations \citep{Cohen1989}. The correlation between the variable of interest and the covariates as well as the correlation between the covariates themselves was always set to zero. The correlation matrix for the data structure when there is only one dependent variable is presented in Table S11 in the Supplementary Material. If a variable was generated as a normally distributed variable, it was generated with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, while binomial variables were generated with a 50\% chance of success in each trial. To test how the sample size affected the FPP and FPR, the simulation included samples with sizes ranging from 100 to 300 with increasing steps of 50. 

\subsection{Simulation}
In the simulation results presented in the main results section, we only included cases in which the variable of interest and covariates had the same distribution. The two other cases i.e., when the variable of interest was binary and the covariates were continuous and the other way around can be found in the results section in the Supplementary Material (ADD REF). For analyses not addressing the effect of sample size, the default sample size was kept constant at 200. When the effect of different correlation levels between covariates was not analyzed, the correlation between the dependent variable and covariates was set to a default of \textit{r}=0.2.\\
We used R \citep{Team2018} to perform our simulation with 10,000 simulation iterations. When the covariates had a binomial distribution, the variables were simulated using the package BinNor \citep{Demirtas2014}. This was done to ensure that the correlation matrix would also hold under this data type. The data were analyzed with linear regressions. We defined a false-positive result as any model where the variable of interest was significant ($p < .05$), either in a main effect or in an interaction with a covariate variable. The FPP was defined as \\

\[FPP_i=\left. \left\{\begin{array}{c}
1\ if\ any\ model\ in\ iteration\ i\ produces\ a\ false-positive\ result \\ 
0\ otherwise\  \end{array}
\right.\] 
\[FPP=\frac{\sum_{i}^{N}{FPP_i}}{N}\] 

The FPR is the ratio of the models with a false-positive result and was defined as \\

\[FPR_i=\frac{\#false-positive\ models\ in\ iteration\ i}{\#all\ models\ in\ the\ set\ in\ iteration\ i}\] 
\[FPR=\frac{\sum_{i}^{N}{FPR_i}}{N}\]
