- in equation 1, does n mean covariates in- or excluding the variable of interest?

- Table 2 and 3 should also show cases with no main effects

- set names must be changed to something meaningful e.g.
H + Cov
H * Cov
Cov * Cov

- figure 2 and 3 should perhaps show absolute values rather than differences. 

- empty sets must be removed from figure axes not to give the impression that the sets have zero FPP/FPR

- main=false and main=true must be renamed to something meaningful e.g.
main effects included
main effects excluded
